# MetaX
**MetaX** is a novel tool for the streamlined annotation of peptide sequences with taxonomic and functional information based on the lowest common ancestors. This versatile tool connects species-specific functions, enabling a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between taxonomy and functionality. Furthermore, MetaX incorporates robust statistical modules for differential analysis of species-function contributions across distinct groups.
