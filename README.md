# MetaX

**MetaX** is a novel tool for linking peptide sequences with taxonomic and functional information in **Metaproteomics**. We introduce the ***Operational Taxa-Functions (OTF)*** concept to explore microbial roles and interactions ("**who is doing what and how**") within ecosystems. 

MetaX also features <u>statistical modules</u> and <u>plotting tools</u> for analyzing peptides, taxa, functions, proteins, and taxon-function contributions across groups.
