# MetaX
**MetaX** is a novel tool for the streamlined annotation of peptide sequences with taxonomic and functional information based on the lowest common ancestors. We propose the Operational Taxa-Functions (OTF) concept, a new approach for exploring microbial roles and interactions ("who is doing what and how") within ecosystems. It connects taxon-specific functions, enabling a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between taxonomy and functionality. Furthermore, MetaX incorporates robust statistical modules for differential analysis of species-function contributions across distinct groups.
